Boilerplate React App

#REDUX
- library who Helps to maintain states
- all states are managed by TodoApp component
## TodoApp component
We have 3 pieces in out initialState:
- showCompleted: false,
- searchText: '',
- todos:TodoAPI.getTodos()

And we have 3 handleling functions and it's rerally annoing
Redux helps to maintain state of application separated from components.

### Concepts
- states --> properties used by components
- actions --> dependending of the defined action it changes states
